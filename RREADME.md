# ShoCase

## Description

ShoCase™ is a full stack web application that serves as a social media platform for sharing anime reccomendations through a playlist format. The user is able to make playlists of 4 animes, comment on other users playlists, and save playlists within their liked page. 

The project utilizes an Express backend, RESTFUL api, mySQL database, and a third party API.

While building this project we learned to:
- Make various calls to a database model and serve them to the front end
- Utilize handlebars to display multiple unique pages for our app
- Create Models, associate them too each other, and seed those Models with data
- Organize third party API responses into a request body in order to store that information in our database
